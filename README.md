THE MPC LIVE MK II CONFIRMED (2020-03-18)

ONE MONTH LATER : CONFIRMED. Look at the FCC web site : 
https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=Y&application_id=RfTo93wUp5E%2FXSCXNY9a4Q%3D%3D&fcc_id=Y4O-ACVB

## THE MPC LIVE MK II SOON (2020-02-01) ?

Some trace of a new MPC in the last 2.72 firmware MPC binary (beyond my previous post in gearslutsz) :

and confirmed by the existence of 2x4 dtb linux drivers in the /boot directory :

we can therefore deduce that the 5 MPCs will share the same software platform and mainly the same hardware.
This is very good news for MPC Live owners as that means updates and new features probably in a next future for all
(note taht the Force software is a bit different).

However, this may also mean that some features will not be available on all MPCs.  For example, it is clearly stated in the latest user 
manual that the ONE MPC does not have the Ableton controller, even though the firmware is exactly the same as on the Live.

I have also seen areas mentioning new plugins that I think will be present in new releases or reserved for the new MPC?

MPC:Bassline
MPC:Electric
MPC:TubeSynth
=> NEW
MPC:DrumSynth
MPC:Xpand
MPC:OrganB3
